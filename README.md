Project 2 in C# course: Module 2 (after 8 weeks of lessons in C#, win forms and WPF)


Task: create a digital version of the boardgame Game of Goose.


App Requirements
---------------------------------------
Does the app run correctly?
Are 2- 4 players allowed?
Is there are a Player class?
Is there a a Game(Board) class?
Is there a Dice class?
Does the UI accurately portray the players and squares?

Coding Requirements
---------------------------------------
Use of inheritance
E.G. The squares. -> Abstract square -> Regular Square -> Goose Square, Special Square
Use of Composition
Favour composition over inheritance
Use of Interfaces
Program to an abstraction, rather than an implementation
Use of Polymorphism
Correct use of Public, Protected and Private accessors.
You should have a compelling reason for every item you make public. If you don't, hide it.
Each variable should have the smallest possible scope
Are the public methods Unit Tested?
Consider the Test Driven approach. Write tests first while performing the analysis / before each new functionality and them implement said functionality
Do the variable and method names accurately portray their function?
Correct CapitalizationForPublicPropertiesAndMethods
